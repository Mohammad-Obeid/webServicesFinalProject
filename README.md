# Hotel Management System

## Project Overview
The Hotel Management System is designed to streamline operations for both hotel employees and guests. It offers functionalities for customers such as searching available rooms, reservations, check-ins and check-outs, and invoice generation. Employees can manage room availability, maintain customer profiles, and oversee housekeeping schedules. This project implements a set of RESTful APIs based on Spring Boot to enable the development of the required system frontend (web and mobile interfaces).
